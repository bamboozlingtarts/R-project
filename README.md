Using a dataset containing predictor and response variables, this program performs the following:

1. Visualizes the data using a scatter plot.
2. Compares different polynomial linear regression models.
3. For the optimum model—chosen by comparing R² values and AIC scores—it calculates and displays the confidence interval when X = 0.
